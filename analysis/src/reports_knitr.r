#reports are a less cumbersome way to share analysis summaries and include with scripts and figures
#this summarizes the analysis and put them into a report
#R markdown is used to create these reports, can support R code and can be converted to html
#package within R markdown that is used is knitr
#if you get an errors mean you just need to re-run a section not the whole thing

#create new file, create R markdown, keep it at HTML

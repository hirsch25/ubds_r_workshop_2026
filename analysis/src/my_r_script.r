101 + 101
3 + 5 * 10

# help me remember PEMDAS
3 + (5*10)

# I want to add first
(3 + 5) * 10

#do I need multiplication symmbol with paratheses? yes
(3 + 5) 10

#exponents 
3 ^ 2

#are these equal? True
10 == 10

#are these equal? False
9 == 10

#computers aren't great with decimals
10.01 == 10.01
10.02 == 10.01
10.01 == 10.0000000001
10.0 == 10.00000000000000000001

#what do fractions look like here

#R has functions
#get working directory
getwd()
#math functions
sin(1)

#R is like math
#this is the assignment manager: what ever computation happens on the right side, I want you to store it as x
x <- 1/40
x = 1/100
#short cut for assignment operator
# ? can be used to look up things in the help tab via the console

#R is a vectorized language
#this says I want a vector with 1 followed by 2, 3, 4, 5
1:5
x <- 3:10

#vectors can be used in computations
2 ^ (x)

#ls is similar to ls in the terminal to know what the vectors are in the global environment

#rm can also be used like the terminal
